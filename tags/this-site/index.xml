      <description>&lt;p&gt;I automated the deploy process of this blog by using github actions. This site is built with Hugo and hosted by github pages. At first I did the deploy process manually, but now this site is automatically updated when I write a new post and push it to master.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is built with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Hugo is written in Go and is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. Hugo allows you to create a rich static site easily. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a professional front-end web developer or an experienced Go programmer. All you have to do is edit a toml file and write your posts as a markdown format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
